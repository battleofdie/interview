1. Top-K search strings, large input
2. Return first character that only occuring one time followed with occuring twice 
   Roman to integer
3. check whether two strings are rotated permutation or not
   ex. 'abcde' and 'cdeab' will return true
   ex. 'abcde' and 'cdeba' will return false
4. Java basic concepts, stupid!!! 
   Reverse words in a string in place, keep the delimiters
